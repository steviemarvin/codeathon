to create the food insecurity variable we used existing variables "CURFOODSUF", "FOODRSNRV1", and "FREEFOOD". "CURFOODSUF" asks the respondent q question about household food sufficiency for the last 7 days and is also the gateway question for "FOODRSNRV1", which is an indicator variable that tells us whether or not the respondent did not have enough food to eat because of affordability issues. We also incorporated "FREEFOOD" which asks the respondent if they or anyone in the household was able to get free groceries from a food pantry, food bank, church, or other place that helps with free food. For future iterations of this project, we would like to future explore the dynamics between these metrics of food affordability and accessibility. When assigning the values to the food insecurity variable we used TRUE ~ 2 because we felt that it didn't make sense to designate respondents that didn't fall within our parameters to be simply designated as food secure. There were other variables that measured food inaccessibility/insecurity because of health and safety concerns, so we placed others in this 2 category as a placeholder until further research. 

we used a similar process for the confidence in ability to pay rent measure.
